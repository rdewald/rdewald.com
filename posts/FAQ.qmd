# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Is this free?

The information on this website is free. My consultation services have fees—see the [fee schedule](../posts/fees.qmd) for details.

This website is a resource for:

- Those considering whether to ask for my help.
- Those who cannot afford private case management.
- Those experienced with managing someone's traditional medical care (focused on curing disease and prolonging life) who now seek a comfortable, self-determined life closure at home under family management.

## Q: Can you come to my home?

Yes—home visits are essential to how I work, but I will work virtually when that's a good fit.

**No-cost travel:**

- Five boroughs of New York City (reachable by public transit)
- Central New Jersey (Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, and Union counties)

**Pass-through expenses only:**

- Locations requiring a private car
- Anywhere in the United States
