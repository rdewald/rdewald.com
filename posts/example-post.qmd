# Frequently Asked Questions.

Q: Is this free?

Yes.  I am available for consultation with patients and families facing medically-complex terminal illness they want to manage at home. This information is available to assist those contemplating my help, who can't afford to hire any private case manager, and for those who are skilled in managing their care in traditional care models (cure disease, prolong life) who desire, owing the life-limiting consitions, a comfortable, autonomous, self-determined life closure.
