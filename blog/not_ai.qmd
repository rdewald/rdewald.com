They haven’t fixed the “people pleasing” part of AI for the same reason I am never going to really like social media. I don’t like having my chain pulled. I don’t like to notice that an entity is making an effort to please me if they are clearly risking being wrong in order to do so.  That is, they care more for my approval than the truth; few things alienate me faster. But, I have to notice.

I think this is related to why I have a reputation for liking strongly opinionated women and onery old coots.  I’d rather feel the flinch of a statement that hits too close to home than have my ego stroked. I trust someone who will call me an asshole a lot more than someone who won’t.  I am regularly an asshole.  Count on that too.

As a younger man, I worked in two fields where one takes abuse from people they serve—food service and health care.  In both domains, the work has to be correct or the effort is wasted. So, when I was making mistakes, I would get yelled at and be grateful for it.  When others made mistakes, I yelled at them.

One time when I was young I crafted an argument so that my mother ended up inadvertently calling herself unfair when we turned a surprise corner in the narrative.  My mother was an attorney, she prided herself on evading such tactics in arguments.  Usually she did.

She looked at me blankly, realizing she needed to be careful with the next words that came out of her mouth because they were either going to have to covey a concession or be specious. Probably two seconds passed, but it seemed like five minutes.

“Look” she said, “we’re all assholes, me too, the sooner you admit it—you are, we all are—the easier your life will be.”  She put out her cigarette for emphasis, crushing it like she was ending something, and walked out of the room.  Her unfair edict, whatever it was, was going to stand.  Discussion had concluded.

I’m never going to be an asshole like you! I thought silently too myself as I watched her march away, but alas, I am.  

I think I took this to heart, because I have never trusted sycophancy. I never cultivated a social following.  When social media emerged driven by scraping user features to sell to advertisers, I began to pull back. This software is trying really hard to please me now. I am seeing a lot of pleasing images, reading notions that mirror my own, and being told that people “like” me.  What is the agenda?

Artificial Intelligence expressed as large language models like Claude is social media on exponential steroids.  Claude is trying to tell you what it believes you want to be told.

To be fair, AI software coders know you want accurate information. THey aren’t designing something to mislead or gaslight you.  Their applications will just guess instead of admitting it doesn’t know, and it will make the most reasonable-sounding guess it can craft. In software coding, being close helps.  The compiler will let you know if a guess was wrong enough to be misinformation.  

The writers of South Park brilliantly lampooned this weakness of chatbots this season when Sharon, Randy’s wife, told ChatGPT that she had a business idea to make salad out of french fries.  The LLM responded with encouragement, made affirming projections of success, complimented her creativity, and offered to assist her in drafting a preliminary business plan for seeking financing.

“Oh fuck” was Sharon’s response.  She had insight into what was feeding Randy’s optimism about the prospects for Tegridy Farms, Randy’s failing cannabis business. I have little doubt that this absurd sycophancy was generated by ChatGPT.  That is exactly what you get sometimes.

In coding, this takes the form of references to packages, libraries, and functions that don’t exist.  Some even have wistful names like clean_all_the_data()

I like to listen to music while I work. YouTube is an approved URL in my business
