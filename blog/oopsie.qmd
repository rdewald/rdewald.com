Apologies to my paid subscribers (and highly-engaged free subscribers) -- your email addresses were in the wrong field of "The x-ray" email I just sent.  I've fixed the issue, and you will be receiving this and future emails with addresses in the BCC field like this one.

Sorry. Technical oversight. I wish I had someone else to blame.

I know almost all of you, we're a nice group of people, no real risk for that, I just wish I had been more careful.

Stay safe out there.
