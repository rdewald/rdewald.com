The daily posts for Richard’s Rants have migrated to the RDeWald.com/blog.  I discuss the reasons here: 

Roll your own Rants is a monthly roll-up of the activity on RDeWald.com/blog, for my Substack reader’s convenience. 

If you want to receive email copies of the new posts on RDeWald.com/blog as they are published there, email that request to rdewald@rdewald.com. 

It’s free, and worth every penny.
