Welcome to the website of Richard DeWald RN BSN, specialist in end-of-life clinical informatics and medically complex healthcare management. I serve in two ways: by this freely available website and through personalized in-home and virtual consultations.

In the late stages of my career, I'm committed to sharing what I've learned with those who need it most. I bring together decades of home-based nursing experience with technical expertise as a clinical informaticist to help patients and families navigate medically complex home care. I combine the tried-and-true empathy and compassion of hands-on nursing with the judicious use of cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools to explore care options. 

I am especially useful helping patients cared for by multiple medical providers from different specialties. I orchestrate their separate plans into a sane, evidence-based, up-to-date whole which is understandable and communicated to all involved.

I have always believed that if a medical provider can't explain their care-plan to an inquisitive (Why are you doing that?) sixth grader they don't understand it themselves.  My role isn't to tell you what to do, my role is to explain what can be done and which choices are good ideas given your desires.  If you're frustrated with discussing care plans with medical providers and then realizing later you still have questions, I can help.  

I know the magic words and procedures to respectfully get relevant answers from your doctors. I know what can be done at home and what can't.  More importantly in the US, I know who pays and how.

My last question will always be "are there any concerns we haven't addressed?" 

I don't leave until your answer is "no."
